The following is my personal research that I conducted when I was forced to move onto the 4G network.  I liked my 3G phone better.   I expressly do not guarantee any setting or feature or anything else.  I expressly will not be updating this list regularly or possibly even ever.

I only started selling phones because so many people, myself included, were fed up with 4G flip phones.  Additionally I only researched phones that were under $200.  Sending MMS was not a priority in my research.  The only thing I look for in a phone is the ability to call and text. Getting a 4G phone to do that is hard enough.  The 4G phones are not the same quality as the 3G phones that you are used to.

All phones that I sell are $150 which includes koshering. All sales are final.  There is absolutely no warranty on any phone that you purchase; either from me or from the company.  Once a phone is koshered the firmware is edited the company warranty is voided and can’t be returned to the company.

Most flip phones are as sophisticated as Smart Phones these days.  You could use the browser on them with either data or wifi.  Turning off data from the cell carrier won’t help because there is plenty of free wifi available.

If you kosher a flip phone through TAG in most cases this will be permanent; a factory reset will not remove the filter.  In general I use the same software as TAG.

For most flip phones the koshering process will remove ALL your contacts/pictures/notes/etc.

There are different levels of kashering a phone.  In most cases the minimum will be removing the browser and video playback.  Koshering level depends on the phone.  If you wish to change the koshering level at a later date for most phones this may be possible, however in most cases ALL your contacts/pictures/notes/etc. will be deleted.

Currently many of the cell carriers are phasing out the 3G network.  Looking toward the future 4G phones will work on the 5G network but the data will operate at 4G speeds.

When buying a phone two things to look for which make a very large difference.  How much RAM does it have?  Which OS (operating system) does it run?

The more RAM the faster it will respond (to user input).
Some OS were built for specific clientele in mind and to the people who they weren’t built for usually get very frustrated.
Buying guide

The following few phones I recommend to people.

Schok classic flip phone- works well with every GSM network.  It’s supposed to work on Verizon even though the box claims that it won’t, some people had no issues, some people did.  I personally think that the people who it didn’t work for was because they didn’t try to connect it.  They didn’t try to connect it to Verizon because the technician in the store looked at the box and said it won’t work.  The manufacturer told me that the information on the box is outdated and that the phone has passed everyone of Verizon’s rigorous testing specifications.

Check the IMEI number of the phone on your providers website to see if it is compatible.  The phone is sold unlocked.

One person reported to me that the screen broke off.

One person responded that the battery drained very fast.

All others didn’t report any issues.

I personally noticed that the phone operates a little bit slower if it is full of old messages and call logs.  To fix this I delete my call log every 3 months; and try to delete old messages ASAP.

When koshered it can’t have waze, video player, browser, hotspot.

LG classic flip-

This phone is locked to Tracfone; however they (Tracfone or Verizon) claim to unlock your phone for free after it’s been activated for 60 days.  This is a new policy which went into effect after Verizon bought out tracfone.  When I called Tracfone asking to unlock a device the receptionist wasn’t aware of the policy change.  Maybe by now all the receptionists have been notified.

This phone once koshered could be configured to have upto waze, smartlist, email, camera, talk, text, hotspot, music player, SD card.  It can’t have a browser or video player.  You can’t sideload any additional apps.  As of this writing this is the only flip phone that I know of that could be unkoshered.

Some people have reported to me that their children throw it on the ground and step on it numerous times and the phone survives.  A few other people have reported to me that the screen cracked or fell off a few months after they bought it.

My personal opinion is that the older phones of this model were built slightly better than current ones.  This is only a guess.

Sunbeam-

People whose only requirement was a qwerty keyboard are very happy with this.  It doesn’t have a qwerty keyboard.  It is sold Kosher directly from the manufacturer.

Sonim XP3-

Ultra rugged.  Built for the military.

There are 4 types of sonim XP3s.  Each one is capable of running on a different major carrier (this is not exactly accurate but; Make sure you buy the correct phone EVEN if its GSM unlocked.  It makes a very big difference which carrier the phone was locked to BEFORE it was unlocked.
